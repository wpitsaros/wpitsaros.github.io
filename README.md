2. My GitHub account was originally created for a non-credit Python course at Wake Technical Community College. It is now being revived for my CTI 110 course and will be used throughout the rest of my educational journey.
3. This repository has been created for assignments in my CTI 110 course. It currently has nothing in it except for this README file.
4. I installed the desktop application for GitHub from desktop.github.com, opened the application and signed in with my GitHub account. Once I was signed in, I was shown all of my existing repositories and encouraged to clone one to my local machine. I opted to follow the instructions provided by the document instead so I could understand how to do so in the future. I clicked on the "+" icon in the top left corner of the screen and selected "clone a repository". I chose my recently created "wpitsaros.github.io" repository as required by my assignment and left it assigned to the default file path that GitHub recommended for my local machine. Then it was available through my local machine and I was able to access the README file for editing by navigating my File Explorer.
