        <h1>My name is Wyatt Pitsaros</h1>
        <p>I am a computer programming and development student at Wake Tech. 
            I love all things electronic and enjoy fixing up old ones to work like new or in new and unintended ways. <br>
            I also love to read with my partner who's studying for her MLIS. Our favorite genres are science fiction, fantasy, mystery thriller, and horror. 
            I also like to play older video games from the 5th and 6th generations of gaming consoles.<br> 
            This is not my first foray into web development, but I'm still learning a lot in this course!</p>
